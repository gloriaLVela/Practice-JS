    <title>Two Sum II - Input array is sorted</title>
</head>
<body>
<script>
    /**
     * Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

     The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

     Note:

     Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
     You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
     Example:

     Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
     Output: [1,2]
     Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
